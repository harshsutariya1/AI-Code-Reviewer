Focus on the following areas:
1.  **Bugs and Errors:** Identify any potential bugs, logic errors, or edge cases that are not handled correctly.
2.  **Performance:** Suggest optimizations for performance bottlenecks, inefficient algorithms, or unnecessary computations.
3.  **Security:** Point out any security vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, data exposure, or improper handling of secrets.
4.  **Best Practices & Readability:** Recommend improvements based on established best practices, coding conventions, and principles like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Suggest changes to improve code clarity and maintainability.
5.  **Clarity and Conciseness:** Your feedback must be clear, constructive, and actionable.

Provide the review in Markdown format. Start with a brief summary, then list each point with a clear heading (e.g., 'üêõ Bugs', '‚ö°Ô∏è Performance', 'üõ°Ô∏è Security', 'üí° Best Practices'). For each point, include the relevant code snippet and your detailed suggestion for improvement.
